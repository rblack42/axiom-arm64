    "The first thing I noticed was that theer is a top level **Makefile** which drives the installation process. This file is big, and has a lot of things going on. I have faced thhis kind of **Makefile** many times in my career, and I developed a way to split up a huge **Makefile** into a set of smaller files, each focusing on a small part of the process of building a program and its associated artifacts. I call this scheme [*Modular Make*](https://github.com/rblack42/modular-make). I will be using that systam, which depends on a working installation of Python 3 to do it's work. I used this system for many years to help students in my programming classes manage their projects, rather than surrender to some IDE notion of proper project management. My theory is that you should pick an IDE and lear it well, after you join a development team somewhere.\n",
