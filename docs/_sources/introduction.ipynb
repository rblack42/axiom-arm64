    "*Axiom* is a computer algebra system that started life as an IBM project called *Scratchpad in 1971. Such systems focus on manipulating the *symbols* of math, not numerical results. IBM worked on this project into the 1990s, renaming the project to *Axiom* along the way. Eventually, the product was sold to the *Numerical Algorithms Group* in England with the idea of making it a commercial product.  That did not exactly succeed, so the decision was made to open-source the project in 2001. Axion joined a group of similar tools now available for research work.\n",

    "My own involvement with *Symbolic Algrbra* systems goes a long way back. In 1973, I began working asan aerospace engineering scientist working at the *Aerospace Research Laboratory* at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio in the 1970s, I was working on developing program code to solve the *Navier-Stokes* equations of fluid flow over bodies flying at hypersonic speeds. We had access to the fastest computers on the planet at the time, so this was exciting work.\n"
